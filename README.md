# flask_webapp_learner_proj
Demo projects that I have done to learn and understand the Flask ecosystem for the development of web applications.

I have used [Tech with Tim](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg)'s channel video on developing web applications using the Flask micro web framework titled **[Python Website Full Tutorial - Flask, Authentication, Databases & More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI)**.

Apart from this, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the developers responsible for developing and maintaining the **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), [Flask-Login](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)** frameworks.
